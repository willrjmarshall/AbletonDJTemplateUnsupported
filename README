This is an open-source template for DJing with Ableton Live 8 with an Akai APC40. You are welcome to do whatever you want with it: perform, distribute, modify, etc.

This template requires the full version of Ableton Live 8. It is best to upgrade to the latest version (currently 8.0.8), as there are stability issues with previous versions.

The template by default requires an Akai APC40. Additionally, it makes use of a number of functions provided by the NativeKontrol apC-CL1+TC1 template, which you can purchase at http://www.nativekontrol.com/nativeKONTROL_apC_Series.html. This is not required, but is definitely helpful.

If you don't own an APC, you could readily map this template to whatever controller you have.

If you have any issues getting this working, feel free to drop me a message.
